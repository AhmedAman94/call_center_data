# Call Center Data EDA

## Analysis Overview

**Date Range**: January 1, 2023, to April 25, 2024

### Assumptions
1. **Data Completeness**: The analysis assumes that the provided data is complete and accurately represents the inbound call volumes for the given period.
2. **Consistent Patterns**: It is assumed that historical patterns in call volumes will continue into the future, which forms the basis for the predictive analytics.
3. **Uniformity in Call Handling**: The analysis assumes uniformity in call handling processes across different times and agents, meaning no significant procedural changes have occurred during the analyzed period.
4. **Stationarity in Time Series**: The time series analysis assumes that the call volume data is at least weakly stationary, meaning its statistical properties such as mean and variance are constant over time.

### Limitations
1. **Data Quality**: Any inaccuracies or missing data points could affect the results and insights derived from the analysis. Efforts were made to handle missing data by imputing missing agent names with "unnamed agent."
2. **External Factors**: The analysis does not account for external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns, service outages, public holidays) that might influence call volumes but are not reflected in the historical data.
3. **Model Assumptions**: The predictive models used (e.g., Exponential Smoothing) rely on specific assumptions about data patterns (e.g., linear trends, seasonality). If the actual call volumes deviate significantly from these assumptions, the forecast accuracy may be impacted.
4. **Static Recommendations**: The recommendations provided are based on historical and forecasted data. They should be dynamically reviewed and adjusted as new data becomes available and as organizational needs evolve.
5. **Technology and Implementation**: Suggestions for using AI and other technologies to reduce hold times assume that such technologies can be effectively integrated into existing systems and processes. Practical implementation challenges are not addressed in this analysis.

### Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations for optimizing staffing levels and improving call handling efficiency. However, it is essential to continuously monitor and update the strategies based on real-time data and changing organizational dynamics.
